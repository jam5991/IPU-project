# Benchmark Results for Sentiment Analysis Model

## Introduction

This document outlines the performance benchmarks of our sentiment analysis model optimized for Graphcore IPUs compared to traditional hardware implementations (CPUs, GPUs).

## Hardware Specifications

- **CPU**: [Specification]
- **GPU**: [Specification]
- **IPU**: Graphcore [Model/Specification]

## Methodology

Benchmarks focus on measuring inference time, throughput (requests per second), and energy efficiency (where applicable).

## Results

### Inference Time

| Hardware | Average Inference Time |
|----------|-----------------------|
| CPU      | x ms                   |
| GPU      | x ms                   |
| IPU      | x ms                   |

### Throughput

| Hardware | Throughput (requests/sec) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| CPU      | x                         |
| GPU      | x                         |
| IPU      | x                         |

### Energy Efficiency (Optional)

| Hardware | Energy Consumption per Inference |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| CPU      | x Joules                         |
| GPU      | x Joules                         |
| IPU      | x Joules                         |
